- Modern society believes in an ethical ledger where your ethical level is judged by tallying up your rights against wrongs
    - this idea allows for a redemption

    - however, the good and bad you have done coexist
        - and so the harm cannot be cancelled out
            - the people you harm are still harmed
- [[Literature allows an emotional experience of issues]]
- [[Tech non-profit organisations are started because of both an excitement from tech and a fear]]
- [[Science and tech often falsely see non-quantitative aspects as ignorable]]
- [[Ad-blocking is the largest consumer revolt in history]]
