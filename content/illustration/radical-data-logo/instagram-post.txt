The Radical Data Project logo is a rolling, mutating thing that continually offers up new possibilities for what the project could be looking for.
.
The logo picks out two adjectives and sticks them together before the word 'data'. You end up with nice creations such as 'curious anti-racist data', 'hopeful searching data', 'sensuous maximal data'. Even repeating adjectives: 'queer queer data'. Watching it, you are invited to think "Ok, so what would that look like? How could I realise 'reconciliatory decolonial data'? What would a society look like if it made space for 'maximal feminist data'? How can we move towards that point?"
.
There are over 10,000 possible combinations, each one offering a new possibility of what radical data could mean. Hopefully, instilling an idea for a project or approach in the heads of the data scientists and artists and citizens reading this. Yep, I mean you.
