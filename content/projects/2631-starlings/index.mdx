‘2631 Starlings’ is about the gap between a living thing and any representation of that thing. It is about the gap between the shark and the stuffed shark.

The project developed an agent-based model using original mathematical biology research to simulate starling murmuration.
A video of 2631 starlings moving and pulsating is shown on a display immediately next to a display showing the simulation of 2631 polygonal starlings.

## Scientific Beginnings

'2631 Starlings' was born out of a research project at McGill University with Aashna Uppal into starling murmuration. These patterns have long fascinated me and I dived into the chance to look at more sophisticated models of these complex biological systems.

The model itself is based overwhelmingly on the paper 'Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model' by H. Hildenbrandt C. Carere and C.K. Hemelrijka. Thanks to the blessings of Open Access academia, the paper is available for free [here](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/6/1349/333856).

## Into Art

It explores the gap between the simulation and reality of nature.

And below is a video of the simulated Starlings.
